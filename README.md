## CA0: Introduction

In this project, we are introduced to *exploratory data analysis* using some of the Python data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook.  
Using the Titanic passengers dataset, we use simple probability methods to predict whether a passenger would survive or not.

## CA1: Search Algorithms

In this project, a problem is solved using various searching methods including **BFS**, **IDS**, and weighted **A\***.  
The problem is searching a graph for recipes, and giving them to the ones who need them in minimum time.

## CA2: Genetic Algorithms

In this project, An investment problem is solved using a genetic algorithm. We find share that we buy from each to get a good return with low risk.

## CA3: Game Minimax

In this project, [Othello](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj_2tLO84b_AhWEhFwKHeZtDacQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eothello.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw08U1qfgjt9kfpZ9o8gDIka) is played by two agents.
One of them uses the *alpha-beta minimax* algorithm to play optimally, while the other agent plays randomly.

## CA4: Naive Bayes

In this project, the class of a numbers is predicted using an implementation of the *Naïve Bayes classifier*. 
We used methods like **Gaussian Naïve Bayes** and **Bernoulli Naïve Bayes** and techniques like *Additive smoothing*. 

## CA5: Machine Learning

In this project, different classifiers are trained on a dataset and the models are tested.  
A home price dataset is preprocessed, split, and used to train a **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest** model to predict price of a house with given features.

## CA6: Neural Networks

- Phase 1: 
      In this project, a neural network is implemented and trained to classify different datasets like sklearn.datasets.make_moons, sklearn.datasets.make_circles, sklearn.datasets.make_classification.  
      Then we trained a model on people reviews on [imdb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) and used PyTorch to train a model.
      The feedforward neural network and various activation functions are implemented and the effects of different parameters are checked.  
- Phase 2:
      Keras and TensorFlow library are used to classify the *CIFAR-10* dataset. different methods like **Data Augmentation** or **Regularization** are used to improve performance of our model.
