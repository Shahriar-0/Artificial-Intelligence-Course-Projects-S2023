    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What did you take into consideration while writing heuristic function?\n",
    "  number of conquered corners with high coefficient since it can never be owned by our rival and it can be influential in the end. And obviously total number of conquered cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the depth effect on total seen nodes, time, winning percentage? \n",
    "  As expected as we dive deeper and check more steps ahead we will have a better chance of winning, but everything comes with a price, the more nodes will get checked which means more memory and more time for checking them. We have to restore balance between them based on our needs. you can check the numbers and see the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is the effect of children orders in performance as we use alpha beta pruning?\n",
    "   Worst ordering: In some cases, alpha-beta pruning algorithm does not prune any of the leaves of the tree, and works exactly as minimax algorithm. In this case, it also consumes more time because of alpha-beta factors, such a move of pruning is called worst ordering. In this case, the best move occurs on the right side of the tree. The time complexity for such an order is O(bm).\n",
    "   Ideal ordering: The ideal ordering for alpha-beta pruning occurs when lots of pruning happens in the tree, and best moves occur at the left side of the tree. We apply DFS hence it first search left of the tree and go deep twice as minimax algorithm in the same amount of time. Complexity in ideal ordering is O(bm/2). you can get more information from this [link](https://www.javatpoint.com/ai-alpha-beta-pruning).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How does the branching factor change during the game?\n",
    "   as we get to the middle of the game it gets bigger since there are more options compare to the beginning. But as we get closer to the end it reduces cause there are not too many empty cells, So it has kinda a form of normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How does alpha-beta pruning helps to reduce time without dropping accuracy? \n",
    "   in alpha-beta pruning we only prune branches that we are sure we will never need for instance if the father of a node is max node so we are min node, and we seen a value which is less than that of our father, so regardless of what we see next we will never be able to change our father's value so it's useless to check them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Was this algorithm efficient for this project?\n",
    "   since our rival is acting randomly so the best choice as explained before is expectimax because we are too protective and a little risk can be beneficial."
